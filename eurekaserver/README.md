# Eureka Server
This server has been set up to run as a docker image.  To get this up and running you need to do the following from the base of this module:
 - `gradle` to build the application

## Push to Docker
 - `docker build -t eurekaserver .` to create the docker image (TODO blend into the gradle build)
 - `docker images` to see the images created
 - `docker run -d -p 8761:8761 --net=host eurekaserver` to start the docker container (exposing port 8761 as 8761) in teh background
 - `docker ps` to see the running containers
 - `docker ps | grep eurekaserver | cut -d" " -f1 | xargs docker stop` to stop the eurekaserver
 - `docker ps | grep eurekaserver | cut -d" " -f1 | xargs docker logs -f` to output the logs of the servers 

## Push to Cloudfoundry
 - `cf push [--no-start]` to push the eureka service to CF
 - `cf cups eureka-service -p '{"uri":"http://discovery-service-suggs.cfapps.io"}'` to set up the eureka-service as a service for others to bind to
 - `cf uups eureka-service -p '{"uri":"http://discovery-service-sih.cfapps.io"}'`
to update the eureka service (e.g. if you have registered to the wrong service)
- `cf restage simple-service`
to restage an application, e.g. after updating the discovery service
